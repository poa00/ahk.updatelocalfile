# Local File Updator
Helps updating local files by comparing versions on specified remote servers.

## Usage
1. Make sure that the `LocalFileUpdator.xml` file exists in the program directory.
2. Run `LocalFileUpdator.ahk` or `LocalFileUpdator.exe`.

The program will access the site spefied in `LocalFileUpdator.xml` and will download and replace the target file when the version on the remote server is newer than the one on local.
